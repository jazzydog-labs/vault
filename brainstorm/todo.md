# Project Plan

## 1. Establish Repository
- [ ] Create initial repo structure as outlined in `repo_structure.md`.
- [ ] Configure CI/CD for automatic version bumps and artifact storage.

## 2. Implement Schema Service
- [ ] Decide on storage backend (Git submodule vs. database).
- [ ] Build validation pipeline to ensure schemas meet standards.
- [ ] Provide CLI commands for retrieving schema versions.

## 3. Evaluate Secret Management
- [ ] Decide whether secrets belong in Vault or a separate repository.
- [ ] If kept here, integrate with enterprise KMS for encryption.
- [ ] If separated, document integration points and access controls.

## 4. Provide Code Generation Tools
- [ ] Explore language targets (Python, TypeScript, etc.).
- [ ] Generate skeletons from schemas and templates.

## 5. Documentation
- [ ] Write guides describing how to use Vault.
- [ ] Include architecture diagrams and example snippets.

*These steps can evolve as more requirements become clear.*
