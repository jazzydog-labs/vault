# Core Principles

1. **Security First**
   - Everything is immutable once published.
   - If secrets are stored here, they remain encrypted using a centralized KMS.

2. **Domain Driven Design**
   - Clear bounded contexts: Schema and CodeGen are mandatory; Secret management is optional and may be split out.
   - Each module exposes interfaces but hides implementation details.

3. **Automation**
   - All writes flow through CI/CD pipelines with auditing.
   - Consumers pull artifacts via CLI or minimal HTTP endpoints.

4. **Versioned Artifacts**
   - Semantic versioning ensures compatibility tracking.
   - Deprecation policies encourage cleanup and updates.
